<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, I'm Danelle! I am an apsiring web developer based in Omaha, Nebraska. I gained interest in web development because my spouse is a software engineer. I've always enjoyed design and have a keen eye for all things technical. Web development is the perfect merge of the two.</p>

<p>I am inspired to create content based on experiences and the world around me. I have three dogs. A Carolina Dog, Husky, and German Shepherd. We love to travel to remote destinations and camp with our pups. It is one of our greatest passions in life. I enjoy taking these inspirations and applying them to my work.</p>

<p>There is no greater joy in life than to have a work-life balance that not only brings you happiness, but also freedom. For me, being able to create content for clients that brings them joy, but I was inspired to create  from a trip to the mountains or on a walk with my dog, is priceless. It's these experiences that give us creativity to take what is being asked and applying a perpective perhaps not thought of before. Making something magical and practical.</p>
