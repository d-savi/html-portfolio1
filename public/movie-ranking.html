<h1>The Best Movies Ever Created</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
 <p>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is not only a beautiful marvel of cinematic history, but it stands the test of time because it was created as if for Tolkien himself. The characters, casting, costume, design, locations, music, everything about these films gives you a sense of gravity for the world in which you live. An appreciation for those in our lives and how precious and short our time is on this earth.</p>

<h3>The Stand</h3>
 <p>The Stand by Stephen King is more nostalgic for me than anything else. I've gravitated towards it over the years. It is about a doomsday apocalypse in whcih you are called by either God or the Devil (Randal Flag). It is about love and perserverance in the face of opposition. All set in a classic 80's cheesy horror film. Staring none the less than Gary Sinise. </p>

<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
 <p>This Studio Ghibli film is one of their most beautiful and lesser known movies. Compared to that of Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro. It is about the devastating conflicts between the spirits and animals of the forest versus humanity. How only through these conflicts, can piece and harmony be achieved.</p>
